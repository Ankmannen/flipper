A collection of useful controls for Xamarin Forms. Under development and always will be.

# Controls

* Swiper - A simple carousel view for images that is lightway and really fast. The image source is a ObservableCollection of strings that represent image urls. [iOS complete, Droid under dev, WP later on]
* CardContentView - An control that will show a CardView on Android, for iOS and Windows Phone it will behave like a regular ContentView.
